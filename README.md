<b>Graphmodeling</b>

This site enables a user to input data for a graphical display. The user then decides on a mathematical function that could fit the data. By adjusting fitting parameters, the user decides when the model adequately fits the data. Once the fitting parameters are determined, the user has manually determined a "best fit" function for the data.
